  abstract = {Hilbert's {$\epsilon$}-calculus is based on an extension of the language of predicate logic by a term-forming operator {$\epsilon$}x. Two fundamental results about the {$\epsilon$}-calculus, the first and second epsilon theorem, play a r\textasciicircum{}ole similar to that which the cut-elimination theorem plays in sequent calculus. In particular, Herbrand's Theorem is a consequence of the epsilon theorems. The paper investigates the epsilon theorems and the complexity of the elimination procedure underlying their proof, as well as the length of Herbrand disjunctions of existential theorems obtained by this elimination procedure.},

In particular, Go\textasciidieresis{}del's 1931 paper on incompleteness and the methods developed therein were important for the early development of recursive function theory and the lambda calculus at the hands of Church, Kleene, and Rosser. Church and his students studied G\textasciidieresis{}odel 1931, and Go\textasciidieresis{}del taught a seminar at Princeton in 1934. Seen in the historical context, G\textasciidieresis{}odel was an important catalyst for the emergence of computability theory in the mid 1930s.},

The restriction to a single conclusion in standard systems of natural deduction requires the introduction of additional rules to make the resulting systems complete; these rules are nevertheless still simple and correspond straightforwardly to the classical absurdity rule. Omitting these rules results in systems for intuitionistic versions of the connectives in question.},

If the permitted accessibility relations are arbitrary partial orders, the resulting logic is known to be recursively isomorphic to full second-order logic (Kremer, 1997). It is shown that if the Kripke structures are restricted to trees of at height and width at most {$\omega$}, the resulting logics are decidable. This provides a partial answer to a question by Kremer. The result also transfers to modal S4 and some G\"odel\textendash{}Dummett logics with quantifiers over propositions.},

An exception is Bonini et al. (1999), who report empirical results on the use of vague predicates by Italian speakers, and take the results to count in favor of epistemicism. Yet several methodological difficulties mar their experiments; we outline these problems and devise revised experiments that do not show the same results. We then describe three additional empirical studies that investigate further claims in the literature on vagueness: the hypothesis that speakers confuse `P' with `definitely P', the relative persuasiveness of different formulations of the inductive premise of the Sorites, and the interaction of vague predicates with three different forms of negation.},

These attempts were largely unsuccessful, also in his own considered judgment. A detailed assessment of Carnap's attempt shows, nevertheless, that his approach is much less confused and hopeless than it has often been made out to be. By providing such a reassessment, the paper contributes to a reevaluation of Carnap's contributions to the development of modern logic.},

  abstract = {After a brief flirtation with logicism around 1917, David Hilbert proposed his own program in the foundations of mathematics in 1920 and developed it, in concert with collaborators such as Paul Bernays and Wilhelm Ackermann, throughout the 1920s. The two technical pillars of the project were the development of axiomatic systems for ever stronger and more comprehensive areas of mathematics, and finitistic proofs of consistency of these systems. Early advances in these areas were made by Hilbert (and Bernays) in a series of lecture courses at the University of G\"ottingen between 1917 and 1923, and notably in Ackermann's dissertation of 1924. The main innovation was the invention of the {$\epsilon$}-calculus, on which Hilbert's axiom systems were based, and the development of the {$\epsilon$}-substitution method as a basis for consistency proofs. The paper traces the development of the ``simultaneous development of logic and mathematics'' through the {$\epsilon$}-notation and provides an analysis of Ackermann's consistency proofs for primitive recursive arithmetic and for the first comprehensive mathematical system, the latter using the substitution method. It is striking that these proofs use transfinite induction not dissimilar to that used in Gentzen's later consistency proof as well as non-primitive recursive definitions, and that these methods were accepted as finitistic at the time.},
